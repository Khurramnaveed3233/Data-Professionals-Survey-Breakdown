## üß© Challenges Faced

- **Data Cleaning**: The dataset included inconsistent job titles and programming languages, requiring standardization.
- **Missing Values**: Several records were incomplete, so filters and clean logic were applied to avoid skewed results.
- **Imbalanced Gender Data**: The majority of responses were from male professionals, so charts were adjusted to show percentages instead of absolute values for better insight.
- **Categorization**: Rare job titles were grouped under "Other" for cleaner visualization and interpretation.
